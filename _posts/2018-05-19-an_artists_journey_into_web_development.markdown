My first encounter with code happened my freshman year at a Chicago art school. I was studying for my Bachelor of Fine Arts, in classes that ranged from studio painting to reading Fyodor Dostoevsky. Each class was challenging in it's own way: how do I make my painting less "muddy" and more "luminescent"? What does Dostoevsky mean by the statement, in *Notes From the Underground*, "Only a fool can become something."? I struggled, but not as profoundly as I did in a class  in which I was required to build a web portfolio from scratch using html/css. 

Each concept proved a new challenge; each failure an existential crisis. Despite all odds (in my mind),  I built my website. At the end of year, it was featured in a juried show showcasing student work. 

Looking back, I can say with certainty that I enjoyed building the website far more than seeing the finished product. The innovation and creativity used to problem solve attracted me then, and it is ultimately what led me to enroll in the FS Web Development at Flatiron School.
