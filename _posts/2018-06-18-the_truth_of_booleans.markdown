Booleans are true or false data types that lend some awesome control flow to code. Often used with if/else statements, booleans allow the processing of one chunk of code versus another. 


```
cat = "cute"
 
if cat == "cute"
  puts "Meow!"
else
  puts "I am not a cat."
end
```


In the above example, if cat==cute is a true statement, it will output "Meow". If cat==cute is a false statement, it will output "I am not a cat". In this case, the output would be "Meow", because the cat is obviously cute.

The beauty of booleans lies in their ability to enact powerful control flow on code using a simple true and false data type.
