Booleans are true or false data types that lend some awesome control flow to code. Often used with if/else statements, booleans allow the processing of one chunk of code versus another. 


```
cat = "cute";
 
if cat == "cute";
  puts "Meow!";
else;
  puts "I am not a cat.";
end;
```


In the above example, if cat==cute is true, it will return "Meow". If cat==cute is a false statement, it will return "I am not a cat".

The beauty of booleans lies in their ability to enact powerful control flow on code using a simple true and false data type.
