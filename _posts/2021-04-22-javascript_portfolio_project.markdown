Wow. That was exhausting. 

After seriously struggling through the Javascript modules, I honestly cannot believe I made it through the portfolio project. Perhaps the meaning behind the project - a monarch butterfly tracking app for my father - or knowing I was almost in the home stretch of completing the program, motivated me to endure this strugglefest. Rather than commend myself further, below are topics I had issues with during the project and would like incorporate more thoroughly in the future:

Object Orientation:

After working with Ruby OOP, I thought I would readily grasp the concept of OOP in JS. Unfortunately that was not the case. I spent days re-reading the material. Perhaps it didn't help that I had already had coded a working procedural application, as it was difficult for me to reimagine some of the functions in a OOP context. Nonetheless, I look forward to returning to the code and refactoring it to be more modular.

Callbacks and Recursion:

On the note of refactoring code, in order to achieve a MVP asap, my code became a little long-winded. I hope to return to it and refactor in a way that takes advantage of some of the great features of JS like callbacks and recursive functions. 

jQuery:

I chose not to use jQuery in this project, but would like to refactor my code in the future in a way that utilizes the library. 

AJAX Calls:

Several long hours were spent debugging a fetch() call. I was trying to POST data from my form and receive a response from the server. The data was saved, but a response was not being returned. Frustrating! On top of that, after form submission, my page mysteriously refreshed and returned to the "home" state. After many hours of researching online, I tried adding preventDefault() to my form submission event. No page state refresh! Then, to fix the fetch() response error, I realized I needed to serialize my data returned from my create action in my controller. Problem fixed!
